Sure! Here's a project idea for Rust:

Create a command-line tool that generates a random password based on user-defined criteria. The tool should allow the user to specify the length of the password, as well as the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Here's a high-level outline of how you can approach this project:

1. Set up a new Rust project using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo new password-generator
   ```

2. Define a struct to hold the user's password criteria, such as length and character types.

3. Implement a function to generate a random password based on the user's criteria. You can use the `rand` crate to generate random numbers and characters.

4. Create a command-line interface using a crate like `clap` or `structopt` to allow the user to specify the password criteria as command-line arguments or flags.

5. Validate the user's input and handle any errors or invalid input gracefully.

6. Generate the random password based on the user's criteria and display it to the user.

7. Test your code to ensure it works as expected.

8. Optionally, you can add additional features such as saving the generated password to a file or allowing the user to specify a custom set of special characters.

Remember to use Rust's strong type system and error handling mechanisms to write clean and robust code. Good luck with your project!
