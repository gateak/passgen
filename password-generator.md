The goal is to create a command-line tool that generates a random password based on user-defined criteria. 
The tool should allow the user to specify the length of the password, as well as the inclusion of uppercase 
letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## 1. Define a struct to hold the user's password criteria, such as length and character types.

## 3. Implement a function to generate a random password based on the user's criteria. You can use the `rand` crate to generate random numbers and characters.

## 4. Create a command-line interface using a crate like `clap` or `structopt` to allow the user to specify the password criteria as command-line arguments or flags.

## 5. Validate the user's input and handle any errors or invalid input gracefully.

## 6. Generate the random password based on the user's criteria and display it to the user.

## 7. Test your code to ensure it works as expected.

## 8. Optionally, you can add additional features such as saving the generated password to a file or allowing the user to specify a custom set of special characters.
